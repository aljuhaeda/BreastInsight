- **`BreastInsight.h5`**: Trained CNN model for breast ultrasound image classification.

- **`BreastInsight.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training the model and performing predictions.

- **`Dataset.txt`**: Information or description about the dataset.

- **`Dataset_BUSI_with_GT/`**: Directory containing the dataset files. (Please upload the dataset files to this directory)

- **`model.fix`**: Model file (you may provide more details on what this file contains).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset). Please make sure to follow the dataset's license and terms of use.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BreastInsight.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd BreastInsight
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Open `BreastInsight.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment and run the cells to explore the code, train the model, and make predictions.

## Model Usage

- Load the `BreastInsight.h5` model file into your application or script.

- Use the model to predict the state of breast ultrasound images.
